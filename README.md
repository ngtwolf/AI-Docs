# AI-Docs
This repository is specifically where I store AI Documentation and Prompts for "Vibe Coding" Workflows.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this, no attribution or anything required.  I'm posting this for my own use but happy to share.  What I try to do, after hours of challenges with AI, is to have the AI write up documentation for me.  I then have the documentation checked by another AI and I do a little back and forth between the two AI's until they are in alignment on the quality of the documentation.  It might still not be correct, but what can you do.  :)
