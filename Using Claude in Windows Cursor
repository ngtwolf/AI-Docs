# Setting up Claude Code in Cursor Terminal on windows

This guide will help you set up a `claude` command in Cursor's PowerShell terminal that automatically runs Claude Code in your current directory.

## Prerequisites

- WSL Ubuntu installed and working
- Claude Code installed in your WSL Ubuntu environment
- Cursor IDE installed

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Open Cursor Terminal
- Open Cursor
- Open a new terminal (Terminal → New Terminal or `Ctrl+` `)
- Make sure you're in a PowerShell terminal (should show `PS` in the prompt)

### 2. Create/Edit PowerShell Profile
In the terminal, run:
```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

If Windows asks if you want to create the file (because it doesn't exist), click **Yes**.

### 3. Add the Claude Function
Copy and paste this function into the notepad file (changing Username to your ubuntu username):

```powershell
function claude {
    $currentPath = Get-Location
    $drive = $currentPath.Drive.Name.ToLower()
    $pathWithoutDrive = $currentPath.Path.Substring(2) -replace '\\', '/'
    $wslPath = "/mnt/$drive$pathWithoutDrive"
    wsl.exe -d Ubuntu -e bash -c "cd '$wslPath' && /home/[USERNAME]/.npm-global/bin/claude"
}
```

**Note:** Replace `/home/[USERNAME]/.npm-global/bin/claude` with your actual Claude installation path. To find it:
1. Open WSL: `wsl.exe -d Ubuntu`
2. Run: `which claude`
3. Use that path in the function above

### 4. Save and Close
- Save the file (`Ctrl+S`)
- Close Notepad

### 5. Close and Reopen Terminal
- Close the current terminal in Cursor
- Open a new terminal (Terminal → New Terminal or `Ctrl+` `)

### 6. Test the Setup
- Navigate to any project directory in your terminal:
  ```powershell
  cd E:\projects\your-project-name
  ```
- Simply type:
  ```powershell
  claude
  ```

Claude Code should now launch in your current directory!

## Troubleshooting

### If you get execution policy errors:
Run this command in PowerShell:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### If the `claude` command isn't found:
1. Make sure you saved the profile file
2. Try reloading the profile manually:
   ```powershell
   . $PROFILE
   ```
3. Verify your Claude installation path is correct

### If you get "cd: No such file or directory":
Double-check that your Claude installation path in the function matches the output of `which claude` in your WSL environment.

## How It Works

The function:
1. Gets your current Windows directory
2. Converts it to WSL format (e.g., `E:\projects` → `/mnt/e/projects`)
3. Runs Claude Code in that directory through WSL

Now you can simply type `claude` in any project directory and it will launch Claude Code in the correct location!
